### Innovator, Entrepreneur, and Developer

I am a huge nerd, probably one of those people who some think is speaking another language entirely, but for those who know, you know. I enjoy developing new ways to automate and constantly looking for new projects to add to my platform for development and testing.

Always willing to help out and learn new things. I am always looking for new ways to contribute to the community and help others.
